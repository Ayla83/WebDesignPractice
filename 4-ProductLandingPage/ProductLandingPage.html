          <h2>Watercolour</h2>
          <p>
            Watercolour is a translucent paint containing pigment and a binder, typically gum-arabic. The gum-arabic holds the paint together and ensures the paint will not flake. The paint has colour pigment suspended in water until the water dries and stains the surface. The paint brushes with fluidity and transparency and dries fairly quickly.

          <h2>Acrylic</h2>
          <p>Acrylic paints are extremely versatile, and ideal for fine brushwork, glazing, staining, water media techniques and many more. This smooth and light paint has excellent pigment quality, colour strength, and durability. The acrylic paint can be applied to almost any stable surface like watercolour paper or canvas. It is quick-drying and can be purchased in a variety of forms, like a tube or small ink-bottle varying in viscosity.</p>

          <h2>Oil</h2>
          <p>Oil-based paint is very durable and provides a glossy-looking finish. Brushstrokes fill themselves into a smooth, rich varnish. Oil-based paint has long-lasting coverage and blends well with others. This paint dries slowly which works in a painter’s advantage since the artist can develop the painting gradually, making changes to the work along the way. Don’t forget about water mixable oil paints. Water mixable oil paint is oil paint with an added emulsifier. This type of paint is water mixable, not water-based. This paint possesses elasticity and is diluted thinly when more water is added.</p>
